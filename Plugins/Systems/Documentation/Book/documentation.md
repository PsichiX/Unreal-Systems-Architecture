# Systems Architecture Documentation

> Systems Architecture is a framework that focuses on modular and scalable game logic.
>
> It rewards using DOD (Data-Oriented-Design) over industry-wide OOP standard for writing
> game logic to reduce occurrence of common pitfals when doing OOP wrong, by avoiding it
> as much as possible and by that reducing comprehensive complexity to bare minimum.

In this documentation you will learn best practices for producing modular and scalable
game systems that together make complex game features, yet still doesn't require countless
hours of organization, production and iteration times in the process of making games.

Systems Architecture is refreshingly simple yet powerful tool to make Unreal Engine game
developers _**Work Smart, Not Hard <sup>TM</sup>**_ and we are gonna achieve that by reducing
complexity of codebase and production process to bare minimum!

Ok, enought pretty words - let's dive into how Systems Architecture works and what problems
does it solve.
